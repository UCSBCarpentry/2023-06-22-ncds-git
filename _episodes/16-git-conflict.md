title: Conflicts
teaching: 45
exercises: 0
questions:
- "What do I do when my changes conflict with someone else's?"
objectives:
- "Explain what conflicts are and when they can occur."
- "Resolve conflicts resulting from a merge."
keypoints:
- "Conflicts occur when two or more people change the same lines of the same file."
- "The version control system does not allow people to overwrite each other's changes blindly, but highlights conflicts so that they can be resolved."

As soon as people can work in parallel, they'll likely step on each other's
toes. This will even happen with a single person: if we are working on a piece
of software on both our laptop and a server in the lab, we could make different
changes to each copy.  Version control helps us manage these [conflicts]({{
page.root}}{% link reference.md %}#conflict) by giving us tools to [resolve]({{
page.root }}{% link reference.md %}#resolve) overlapping changes.

To see how we can resolve conflicts, we must first create one. The file
`index.md` currently looks something like this on both your computer and your
GitHub repository:

What if you make changes to the file directly through GitHub. From the main page
for the repo, click on `index.md` in the file list, then click on the pencil icon
to edit the file.

![GitHub edit file interface](../fig/edit-index.png)

Make a change on the first line of the file and then click "Commit". Now make a
different change to your *local* copy of the file, without.

~~~
$ nano index.md
$ git add index.md
$ git commit -m "another change"
~~~
{: .language-bash}

At this point, your local repository and the repository on GitHub have *diverged*: HEAD
refers to a different commit for each. This is is the making a of a conflict. 

What happens when we try to `push` our repository to GitHub?

~~~
$ git push origin main
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
To https://github.com/user/simple-site.git
 ! [rejected]        main -> main (fetch first)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/user/simple-site.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.

![The Conflicting Changes](../fig/conflict.svg)

Git rejects the push because it detects that the remote repository has new
updates that have not been incorporated into the local branch. What we have to
do is pull the changes from GitHub, [merge]({{ page.root }}{% link reference.md
%}#merge) them into the copy we're currently working in, and then push that.
Let's start by pulling:

~~~
$ git pull origin main
~~~
{: .language-bash}

remote: Counting objects: 100% (5/5), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (1/1), done.

The `git pull` command updates the local repository to include those changes
already included in the remote repository. After the changes from remote branch
have been fetched, Git detects that changes made to the local copy overlap with
those made to the remote repository, and therefore refuses to merge the two
versions to stop us from trampling on our previous work. The conflict is marked
in in the affected file:

~~~
$ cat index.md
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~

~~~
{: .output}

Our change is preceded by `<<<<<<< HEAD`.
Git has then inserted `=======` as a separator between the conflicting changes
and marked the end of the content downloaded from GitHub with `>>>>>>>`.
(The string of letters and digits after that marker
identifies the commit we've just downloaded.)

It is now up to us to edit this file to remove these markers
and reconcile the changes.
We can do anything we want: keep the change made in the local repository, keep
the change made in the remote repository, write something new to replace both,
or get rid of the change entirely.
Let's replace both so that the file looks like this:

~~~
$ cat index.md

To finish merging,
we add `index.md` to the changes being made by the merge
and then commit:

~~~
$ git add index.md
$ git status
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
On branch main
All conflicts fixed but you are still merging.
  (use "git commit" to conclude merge)

Changes to be committed:

	modified:   index.md

~~~
$ git commit -m "Merge changes from GitHub"

{: .language-bash}

Now we can push our changes to GitHub:

~~~
$ git push origin main
~~~
{: .language-bash}

Git keeps track of what we've merged with what,
so we don't have to fix things by hand again
when the collaborator who made the first change pulls again:

~~~
$ git pull origin main
~~~

~~~
remote: Enumerating objects: 10, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (10/10), done.

We get the merged file:

We don't need to merge again because Git knows someone has already done that.

Git's ability to resolve conflicts is very useful, but conflict resolution
costs time and effort, and can introduce errors if conflicts are not resolved
correctly. If you find yourself resolving a lot of conflicts in a project,
consider these technical approaches to reducing them:

- Pull from upstream more frequently, especially before starting new work
- Use topic branches to segregate work, merging to main when complete
- Make smaller more atomic commits
- Where logically appropriate, break large files into smaller ones so that it is
  less likely that two authors will alter the same file simultaneously

Conflicts can also be minimized with project management strategies:

- Clarify who is responsible for what areas with your collaborators
- Discuss what order tasks should be carried out in with your collaborators so
  that tasks expected to change the same lines won't be worked on simultaneously
- If the conflicts are stylistic churn (e.g. tabs vs. spaces), establish a
  project convention that is governing and use code style tools (e.g.
  `htmltidy`, `perltidy`, `rubocop`, etc.) to enforce, if necessary

> A tidy sequence of commits, without a merge commit. After `git rebase --continue` , you push back to the remote.
